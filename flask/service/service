# example systemd service unit file for valkey-server
#
# In order to use this as a template for providing a redis service in your
# environment, _at the very least_ make sure to adapt the redis configuration
# file you intend to use as needed (make sure to set "supervised systemd"), and
# to set sane TimeoutStartSec and TimeoutStopSec property values in the unit's
# "[Service]" section to fit your needs.
#
# Some properties, such as User= and Group=, are highly desirable for virtually
# all deployments of redis, but cannot be provided in a manner that fits all
# expectable environments. Some of these properties have been commented out in
# this example service unit file, but you are highly encouraged to set them to
# fit your needs.
#
# Please refer to systemd.unit(5), systemd.service(5), and systemd.exec(5) for
# more information.
